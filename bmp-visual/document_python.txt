Execution details:
  1. Operating system required: Window 
  2. Execution file: bmp.exe
  3. How to run program:
     - Just double click the file bmp.exe and program will run.
     - Or open terminal and run: .\bmp.exe
     - Note: The program takes few seconds to start because I installed everything
     into just one executable file instead of submitting a large folder of program,so
     that it might be more convenient for you to test.
  4. How to run source code:
     - Source code named: bmp.py
     - Language required: python3
     - Packages required: tkinter(automatically installed with python3.8)
     - Command to run source code:
       	   python3 bmp.py
     - Note: If you don't have tkinter package, you can simply install it by this command:
       	     sudo apt-get install python3-tk
	     
	   
Source code details:
  1. Main logic:
     - The main logic to read original image and make it grayscale, darker and more vivid
     are implemented inside Bmp24BitImage. In this class, there are 4 main methods which are
     "__readImg", "original", "grayscale", "darken" and "vivid"
     
     - __readImg:
       + This is the private method that I called when the object is instantiated.
       + The method simply reads the image file as a binary file then returns a byte array which contains all bytes in the file
     - original:
       + This method simply returns the original pixel values of the image
     - grayscale:
       + This method simply loops through all the image data (just data, not headers) and for each channel R,G,B, it re-calculates the
       grayscale value by using this formula:
       	       r = g = b = int(0.30*r + 0.59*g + 0.11*b)
       + It returns an array of pixels of (r,g,b)
     - darken:
       + This method is quite similar to grayscale, except that it uses a different formula to re-calculate RGB value:
       	       r = int(r * 0.5)
	       g = int(g * 0.5)
	       b = int(b * 0.5)
	 Bascically it just reduce the value by half for every channel
       + It returns an array of pixels of (r,g,b)
     - vivid:
       + This method also loops through image data and re-calculate RGB value. I used a linear equation to calculate new pixel values:
       	      new_value = alpha * old_value + beta
	      where alpha and beta can be intepreted as parameters to control constrast and brightness of the pixel
	 The above equation is the one introduced in the book "Computer vision: Algorithms and Applications" by Richard Szeliski
       + The result actually could be more than 255 or less than 0 so I defined a function named "myround" to round the value back to 0 and 255
       + It returns an array of pixels (r,g,b)
  2. GUI code
     - All the GUI code is put under: if __name__ == "__main__"
       This serves as a main function for the entire program
     - GUI contains 5 buttons which are "fileBtn", "originalBtn", "grayscaleBtn", "darkBtn", "vividBtn" and a label to display image
  3. Program flow:
     - When you first click "Select BMP image":
       	  1. "fileBtn" is clicked, which triggers function "imgSelect"
	  2. First I clean up files and label in case you click the button multiple times to test different images. 
	  3. Inside "imgSelect", I open a dialog for you to choose file
	  4. After you choose a bmp image, I create Bmp24BitImage instance to read raw image and also call original(),
	  grayscale(), darken() and vivid() to process the original image.
	  5. Call drawPixels() to draw image pixel by pixel
	     
     - When you click "Original image", "Make grayscale", "Make darker" or "Make vivid":
       	  1. selectProcessedImg() is triggerd
	  4. Call drawPixels() to draw image pixel by pixel
     - Summary:
	  + As I explained above, all the low-level steps to read a raw bmp image, make it grayscale, dark and vivid are perfomed
	  in "__readImg", "original", "grayscale", "darken" and "vivid" method inside Bmp24BitImage class.
	  + I draw an image byte by byte in "drawPixels" function
